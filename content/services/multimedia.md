# Multimedia

## Catch their attention with imagery

Did you know that for every 1 second of load time reduced on their website, Walmart experienced up to a 2% increase in conversions?

### For **[Google][1]** in 2019 the name of the game is optimization

According to expert sources such as **[Digital Trends][2]** the average size of a website has doubled since 2015.

The main culprit?

### Javascript and Images

Images play such an important role in how we present ourselves on the internet, and with higher resolution screens being developed each year our images are also getting bigger and bigger to fill up as many pixels as they can.

### But what can we do about it?

Images can be ***resized***, ***optimized***, ***minified***, or ***replaced*** entirely with smaller faster alternative such as a SVG (scalable vector graphic).

It takes due diligence, but every image should be optimized.

### Optimized images improve your website by:

- **Reducing data usage for your website's visitors**
- **Improving visitors overall experience by loading your site faster**

Optimized multimedia content on your website is essential.  We can optimize your **image**, **video** and **graphic** content for top performance.
