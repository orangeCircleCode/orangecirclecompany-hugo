# Google Marketing Platform

## Increase your online presence

  There are many platforms from which to choose from when deciding where to launch your digital campaign.

  How do you begin to choose?

### No problem!  We got you covered.

  We regularly monitor market share trends in digital marketing and offer you the top performing options for your particular goals.  This puts you ahead of your competitors out the gate.

  For example, did you know that the Google Search Platform accounts for over 90% of internet searches? Yes...**90%!**

  If your goal is to reach as many customers as possible at the exact time that they are conducting an internet search for your product or services, your best choice is **[Google Ads][1]**.
  Google Ads leverages both the Google Search Network and the Google Display Network.

  Google partners with websites across the internet giving your ads the broadest possible reach.

  Google Ads allows you to customize your campaign to be as broad or focused as you like.
  You can also make changes to your campaign in real time and see the effect of those changes as soon as the next day.

  You have complete control over your budget which you can also change at any time.
  Since Google Ads is a PPC (pay per click) service, you only pay when a person engages with your ad.

### And did we mention you can customize your campaign?

  If you want to target customers using cellphones, that like pizza, that are within 10 miles of your pizzeria between 12 noon and 1:00 P.M on Tuesdays you can do that!

### With Google Ads you have the option of Search Ads, Display Ads, Video Ads and App Ads.

  We will work with you to determine the best options to reach your target audience.

2. Once your campaign is launched we will closely monitor your campaigns performance utilizing Google Adwords statistics as well as **[Google Analytics][2]**
