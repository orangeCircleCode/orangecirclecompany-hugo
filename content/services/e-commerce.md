## If you are a business that makes money, you should have an e-commerce capable website

E-Commerce is simply the ability to make money online with a website. You might be selling tangible goods or you might be selling digital assets such as mp3s, or the rights to use some of your digital artwork.

What E-Commerce solution is right for me?
There are many options out there, but we try to stick with the most popular and reliable solutions.

**Shopify & WooCommerce**<br/>
Each has their pros and cons

Shopify has a monthly cost associated with it, but you never have to worry about hosting.
WooCommerce is free, but it relies on an established WordPress solution.

Both products are great at what they do, it really comes down to what your needs as a business owner is.
We tend to lean towards Shopify as our preferred solution simply because its built to do one thing and one thing only, be the best online e-commerce solution.

If you are trying to save some money, WooCommerce on top of WordPress is still a great choice, but you gotta remember all the other associated costs that come with it, such as hosting, and we mean FAST hosting, WordPress maintenance, etc.

Both solutions also have a plethora of free & paid plugins and extensions for marketing and other various e-commerce features.

Regardless of what you choose for your business, not having an e-commerce solution is not as great as having have one.
